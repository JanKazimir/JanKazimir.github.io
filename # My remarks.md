# My remarks

The live folder, the place that is actually outputting to the web is : content > post (I think)

This thing is slightly a pain to be honest. 

### Posts

create from archetype
copy paste the piece
fill in the yaml
! don't forget to change draft to false, otherwise it only seems to work, then doesn't

then  in command pallette
run task > build site 
then commit and push to github

#### adding images
images go into the static/img folder of the project

then link to that using normal markdown syntax



#### Changing fonts

"<https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cousine:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap>"
this is the link used for the cousine one. It's on the google font page, but truncated, so careful there.

the guide i followed is this:
