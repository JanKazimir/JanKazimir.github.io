When it came time to create this website, I did the *very 2025* thing and asked gemini how to go about it.  The answer actually made sense and I began, as suggested, by brainstorming some features and drawing up a wireframe.
I knew what I wanted: a landing page with a blog, a projects page, and a contact/about page. Simple, and I knew how to make a static page in VScode and push it to GitHub to deploy it, all from my CodeCademy [course](https://jankazimir.github.io/pages/about/#&gid=1&pid=2).

I wrote a mock up, complete with weird colours (so I could see my flex boxes), and I was up and running.
 <!-- tk: include a link to the mockup, the context should be replaced with toc -->

As I was linking the pages together, I began to realise that some of this was going to become a chore. The mockup was done, but far from *good* and it would need a lot of fine tuning to get there. I wasn’t going to make *bad* website, what would be the point?  But mostly, aside from a myriad of small flaws, the biggest problem was that my page just wasn’t a blog.
At that point, creating a new post meant creating a new page, editing the html manually, linking from the homepage by editing the html manually, and linking from the blog page, by… You see where this is going.
I could probably use a markdown to html converter, maybe have a template ready for some copy pasting, but it still seemed like a chore. There had to be a better way…

I figured I had two options : fine tune the design of the mockup, while I learned to implement the features I wanted, or use a template and a static site generator.
[] > Links to static site generator
[] > Link to stack template

I chose the latter.  
Ultimately I will most likely end up learning both things, but using a template gets me results *now*.
Getting results is nice, getting results **now** is better.
